* Tuesday 12:00-2:00, Thursday 12:00-2:00
* (also available by appointment)
* NAC 7/311

## Objectives
This course surveys programming techniques for Psychology research. Students will be introduced to:
* Fundamental programming concepts using the Python programming language:
    - data types, variables, functions, selection, iteration, libraries
* Domain specific python libraries for advanced experimentation and computation:
    - numpy, pandas, geopandas, nltk, beautifulsoup, requests, etc
* Managing programming and creating a portfolio using the `git` version control system

Students are expected to demonstrate their mastery of these topics by executing a research project using data from a domain of Psychology research. They will submit a proposal, two status update short papers, and a final 15 minute presentation and scientific write up (or github pages website)

Please let me know if there's an issue (technical or personal) with registering for these accounts.

## Policies
### Email
Unless I tell you otherwise, email should only be used to set up an in person meeting, inform me about needed accommodations, or discuss confidential material like grades.  Coursework related communications, such as questions on the lecture or homework, should be done through piazza, which allows anonymous posting. If you are uncomfortable with this policy, please speak to me.

### Homework
* Homework must be submitted via github classroom. 
* Homework submitted through other methods without prior approval  will not be graded.
* Questions about the homework should be asked on [piazza]()) using the provided [format](hwq_fmt.md). 
* Emailed questions and questions not in that format may be ignored. 

### Attendence 
* Attendance is mandatory. Can miss 2 unexcused. 
* Missing the final project presentation day (unexcused) will result in an F for the course.
* Send an email at least two weeks in advance about excused absences or exam conflicts.

### Accessibility 
* Have the accessibility center provide documentation for any accommodations ASAP
* Notify me that they've left documentation in my mailbox/etc.
* Set up an appointment to discuss other accommodations. 

### Plagiarism
* First plagerized assignment - 0 for the assignment
* Second plagerized assignment - 0 for all assignments
* Third plagerized assignment - 0 for the course
* Plagerized Final Project - F in the course

In the case of multiple similar homework submissions, plagerism on assignments is determined based on timestamps-the person who submitted first is assumed to be the originator and anyone else is assumed to have plagerized. All students who submit similar exam answers are assumed to be cheating.

Plagiarism is copying solutions from pretty much anywhere, including friends, solution manuals, and random websites. Plagerism is also claiming another person's work (friend, family, freelancing service, etc) as your own. Plagiarism can result in various academic repercussions as described in the CCNY integrity policy: http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/current/integrity.cfm and any work suspected of being plagiarized will be dealt with per CCNY guidelines
